Symbolic Explanations
====================

This plugin is capable of answering similar questions as the Partial Dependencies plugin, i.e.:

* How does the objective change wrt one or two hyperparameters? For example, does the accuracy
  increase if the learning rate decreases?
* Do multiple trials show similar behavior?

While the Partial Dependencies plugin provides a plot describing the effects of hyperparameters on the model
performance, the Symbolic Explanations plugin additionally allows to obtain an explicit formula capturing
these effects.
