    Objective
        An objective is a metric that is to be minimized or maximized. For example, accuracy or loss
        are objectives, whereas accuracy should be maximized and loss be minimized.

    Budget
        A budget is a limit on anything of the algorithm. Most frequently, epochs in Neural Networks
        are restricted or subsets are used.
