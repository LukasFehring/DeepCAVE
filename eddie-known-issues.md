# Overview
* When using a group object with DeepCave runs, the *Optimizer* advertized in the "Quick Information" box is just "group".
* The __(Details)__ in the Quick Information box could be changed to "See configuration" to know that you're jumping to the best configuration.
* The **Quick Information** part could add a line on how many trials were performed, I can't seem to see this number anywhere, it would help distinguish between _trials_ and _configurations_.
* The **Meta** header should probably have a little Q mark or be renamed to **Meta Information**
    * Change `Overview.md` if changing this
    * Need more information about what's actually possible to see here
