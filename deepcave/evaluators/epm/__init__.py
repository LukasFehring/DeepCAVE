Empirical Performance Models.

Empirical performance models are regression models that characterize a given algorithmâ€™s
performance across problem instances and/or parameter settings. These models can predict
the performance of algorithms on previously unseen input, including previously unseen
problem instances and or previously untested parameter settings and are useful for
analyzing of how an algorithm performs under different conditions, select promising
configurations for a new problem instance, or surrogate benchmarks.
