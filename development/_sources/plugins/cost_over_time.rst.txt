Cost Over Time
==============

One goal of using AutoML is to gain high-peak performance. However, you also want to see
how your objective changed over time. To see the change based on the time or number of configurations,
this plugin visualize it for you.

Since multiple runs are supported, you directly see which run performs best.
If you want to display groups (combined runs), you will see the mean and standard deviation too.
