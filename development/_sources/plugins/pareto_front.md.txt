# Pareto Front

Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a situation where no individual or preference
configuration can be chosen due to multiple important objectives which should be considered.
For example, I want to find a configuration for my problem which has both a good performance
and low computational cost. To select a suitable configuration, the pareto front shows you the best
configurations for two given objectives.
